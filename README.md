# Bombardier Dash 8  Q400 Project
This project aims at creating a realistic Bombardier Q400 for flightgear, the free and open-source flight simulator.

Thanks to FlorianK for amazing models+textures, MaverickAlex for the original model (dhc8-400), D-SVEN, Andreas Spiekermann and Jonathan Redpath for great liveries as well as Joshua Davidson for the IT-AUTOFLIGHT system and Patten+Syd Adams for some instruments I took from the CitationX.
