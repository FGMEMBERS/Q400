The Bombardier Q400(NG) is a regional twinprop aircraft originally produced by DeHavilland Canada as the DHC8-400 with the intention to build an aircraft between the DHC7 and DHC6.
There are 3 other variants of this aircraft currently used, the Q100, Q200 and the Q300.
According to Bombardier, the Q400 flies almost as far as a jet but uses much less fuel and produces much less CO2.


The original dhc8-400 for flightgear was built by MaverickAlex et. al. It is currently being modified to fit the current standards by FlorianK who does cockpit, ex- and interior work, (short: 3D) and D-ECHO who re-modelled the exterior and is corrently modifying the sound so that it sometime in the future sounds like a real Q400 ;)
