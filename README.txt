The Bombardier Q400(NG) is a regional twinprop aircraft originally produced by DeHavilland Canada as the DHC8-400 with the intention to build an aircraft between the DHC7 and DHC6.
There are 3 other variants of this aircraft currently used, the Q100, Q200 and the Q300.
According to Bombardier, the Q400 flies almost as far as a jet but uses much less fuel and produces much less CO2.


The original dhc8-400 for flightgear was built by MaverickAlex et. al. It is currently being modified to fit the current standards by FlorianK who does cockpit, ex- and interior work, (short: 3D) and D-ECHO who modelled also and did system work. ;)
A special thanks also goes to D-Sven, who did the Airberlin, Austrian Airlines and Austrian Airlines (Star Alliance) liveries as well as Jonathan Redpath who did the Porter Airlines, Alaska Airlines express 2017, Flugfelag Islands and Qantas Link liveries and Andreas Spiekermann for improvements to the wing fairings, sounds and the great Alaska (N44IQX), Luxair (LX-LGA) and Bangladesh liveries.
